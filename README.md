# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The Analysis is intended for innacurate data for the grade nines at Thomas High School. We are looking to analyze how this imapcted:

- The math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by School spending
- Scores by School size 
- Scores by type of School


## Results

In the table below, We see a few patterns that stand out. The achievement between Charter Schools and District Schools, with the former having higher scores in both Math and Reading. Additionally, the Per Student Budget is not an indicator of achievement in the Math and Reading scores. Further evaluation is needed to understand why certain schools did better.

The below table is for grade nine students from Thomas High School removed. Minuscule change was obvserved across the categories.

## Summary

The biggest changes we saw were rate of overall passing, which removing the faulty data of grade nines clears up. Given that not much changes in the categories we were looking at, we can conclude that the imopact was minimal.
